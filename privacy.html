      the Site to help analyze out web page flow, customize our services,
      measure promotional effectiveness, and promote trust and safety. A few
      important things you should know about cookies are that: We offer certain
      features that are only available through the use of cookies. We use
      cookies to help identify you and maintain your signed-in status. Most
      cookies are session cookies, meaning that they are automatically deleted

      decline out cookies if your browser permits, although doing so may
      interfere with your use of the Site. You may encounter cookies from third
      parties on certain pages of the Site that we do not control. (For example,
      if you view a web page created by another user, there may be a cookie
      placed by that web page.) NO SPAM, SPYWARE OR SPOOFING We do filter and
      automatically scan messages before they are sent for viruses and other
      illegal or prohibited content but do not permanently store email messages
      sent through these tools. ACCOUNT PROTECTION Your password is the key to
      your account. Use unique numbers, letters, and special characters and do
      not disclose your applianceoutletandhome.com password to anyone. If you do
      share your password or personal information with others, remember that you
      are responsible for all actions taken in the name of your account. If you

      if it changes or is inaccurate. Upon your request, we will close your
      account and remove your personal information from view as soon as
      reasonably possible, based on your account activity and in accordance with
      applicable law. We do retain personal information from closed accounts in
      order to comply with law, prevent fraud, collect any fees owed, resolve

      otherwise permitted by law. SECURITY Your information is stored on our
      servers located in the United States. We treat data as an asset that must
      be protected and use lots of tools (encryption, passwords, physical
      security, etc.) to protect your personal information against unauthorized
      access and disclosure. However, as you probably know, third parties may
      unlawfully intercept or access transmissions or private communications,
      and other users may abuse or misuse your personal information that they
      collect from the Site. Therefore, although we work very hard to protect
      your privacy, we do not promise, and you should not expect, that your
      personal information or private communications will always remain private.

      they are buyers, or sellers on our Site or other sites throughout the
      Internet, different rules may apply to their use or disclosure of the
      information you disclose to them. Since applianceoutletandhome.com does
      not control the privacy policies of third parties, you are subject to the
      privacy policies of those third parties. We encourage you to ask questions
